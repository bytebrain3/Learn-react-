# Learn React with Me

## Who Am I?
I am a Vue3 developer, and now I've decided to learn ReactJS ⚛️. I'm documenting my learning journey and sharing it with others. You can follow along with what I learn on Twitter [here](https://x.com/dip_mondal3).

## What is React?

Imagine 💭 you want to build a super cool **LEGO house 🏠**. Each piece of LEGO is like a building block. You can snap them together to make something bigger, and if you want to change something later, you just replace or adjust the blocks 🔁.

React is like **LEGO for websites or apps**. It helps you build parts of a website by snapping together pieces (called **components**). Instead of building a whole website from scratch, React lets you create small parts like buttons, menus, or images, and then combine them to create the full website.

### Why is React Useful? 🤔

- **Fast ⏩**: React only updates the parts of a page that change, making everything super quick.
- **Organized ✨**: You can keep your code clean and modular by breaking down a large website into small, manageable parts (components).
- **Popular 📈**: Big websites like Facebook and Instagram use React because it's easy to use and powerful!

## How to Create a React Site

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Before starting with React, you need **Node.js**. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Download Node.js**:  
   Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version.
   
2. **Install Node.js**:  
   Run the installer and follow the instructions. The installer will also include npm (Node Package Manager).

3. **Check Installation**:  
   After installation, open your terminal and run these commands to ensure everything is set up:

   ```bash
   node -v    # This should print the installed Node.js version
   npm -v     # This should print the installed npm version
   ```

### Step 2: Create a New React Project with Vite

1. **Create a new Vite project**:  
   Use the following command in your terminal to create a new project using Vite (a fast frontend tool):
   
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

   For **pnpm** users, you can use:

   ```bash
   pnpm create vite@latest
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   After setting up, go into your project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

For **pnpm** users, use:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start your React development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or for **pnpm** users:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully created your first React app!
